        <h1>Stir-fried Tomato and Scrambled Eggs</h1> 

        <img src="dish.jpg"/>

        <p>Stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs are a common Chinese dish, and it was also the first dish I learned how to make. However, the point is <strong>I don't eat eggs</strong>, so I had never known the taste of the dish I cooked for my family : D</p>
